# mdast-util-footnote

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`mdast-util-gfm-footnote`][gfm-footnote] (or
[`mdast-util-gfm`][gfm], which includes it and all of GFM) instead.
Those packages match how footnotes work on github.com, which is more likely
to match the expectations of your authors.

Legacy [documentation for this
package](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-footnote/tree/13c67e0)
is still available in Git.
